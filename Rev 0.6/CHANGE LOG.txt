---------------------------
DONE:
1. Changed all headers to 2.54mm (0.001") to make them easier to solder / buy.
2. Made new PCB layout that was much smaller (5" by 3" from 6" by 3.5").
3. Put all major bypass caps on back of board and made sure all others were not blocked by sockets / chips.
4. Added labels to silkscreen to help with assembly.

TODO:
1. Change the footprint of the Dallas chip to something that can be soldered easily.
